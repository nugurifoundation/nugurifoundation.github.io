## A Free Website Template for Nonprofits
We want to help introduce the nonprofit community to the powerful world of open source development. Just follow the step-by-step instructions below, and in less than an hour your grassroots nonprofit will have a live, no-cost website complete with online donation capabilities.

But most importantly, by hosting your site and its code on Github you'll allow volunteers to easily contribute to ongoing development of your site.  

___
#### No Coding Skills Required  
If you're the type of person that can set up email on your smartphone, you likely have all the skills needed to take advantage of this template. This isn't that hard...you can do it! :smile:

___
#### Help Others Help You  
Github makes it crazy simple for people to help with your site. Whether it's volunteers or paid contractors, you're always just a few clicks away from accepting improvements.

#### Features  
1. Accept online donations  
2. Capture email addresses to begin building your supporter database

#### Benefits  
1. **Open Source**  
    Your site and its code will be hosted on Github. This makes it easy for any developer, designer, or copywriter to help customize your site.

2. **Totally Free**  
    No upfront nor ongoing costs.   

3. **Payments by Stripe**   
    [Stripe](https://stripe.com/gallery) is used by many [tools for nonprofits](https://stripe.com/docs/integrations#fundraising). When you require a more robust fundraising solution than DonorBox offers, switching is easy.
